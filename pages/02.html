                <p style="font-size: large;">But how?</p>
                <p>There are many ways to begin to find and express one's true identity, one of which I am doing right now! Making personal websites is a really fun way of doing it, as it allows you to share your thoughts (again, as I'm doing now) in an artistic way without needing to compare oneself with others.</p>
                <p>However, there are countless other ways of doing so! The only real thing that inhibits something from being an individual process is the inability to express your thoughts coherently. So, anything in which you think freely of preset expectations is an amazing way of freeing yourself from the norm of cyclical thinking.</p>
                <p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 1.25rem;">Examples of means to express oneself:</p>
                <ul style="text-align: left;">
                    <li>Art</li>
                    <li>Music</li>
                    <li>Journaling</li>
                    <li>Creating things! (Sewing, DIY, Clothing, Jewellery, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After you learn who you are, you can begin to show yourself to the world! Earlier, I spoke about how we can begin to enjoy people for their whole selves, and this is the next big step one should follow. Learning from others is one of the most beautiful things; it gives people the ability to share themselves, and it allows us as a collective to grow. So, please, go and find likeminded (and, most importantly, non-likeminded) individuals and learn about them; talk to them, read their blog, analyze their art, listen to their music, listen to their sorrows.</p>
